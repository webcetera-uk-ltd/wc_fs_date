# Current Year (based on a Finsweet hack)

This code is designed for use in Webflow projects, but should work on any other platform where you can add custom attributes.

Essentially any div with an attribute of 'fs-hacks-element' that has a value of 'hack14-year' wil have its content replaced by the current year.

This is useful for things like copyright notices where you want to say Â©2024...

Before starting to work with this template, please take some time to read through the documentation.

## TODO

Expand the script to add fucntionality for other purposes, and also remove the fs hack type wording.
